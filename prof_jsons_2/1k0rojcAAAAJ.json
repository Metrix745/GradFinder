        "In this talk, I will introduce my newly created data visualization projects about various environmental issues such as drought, wildfire and plastic pollution. The projects explore new ways of visualizing and sonifying data in conjunction with art and technology, and bring awareness about climate change issues to the viewers.",
        " Visualization can be a powerful tool to enhance learning and to better support the learning process. Tailoring visualization to the specific audiences and goals of these situations can increase the likelihood of effective communication. In many cases, visualizations which require limited prior specific domain knowledge are helpful. Similarly, when crafting visualization development experiences for students in visualization courses, selecting easy-to-understand application domains for projects helps students to leverage their existing intuition about the domain in order to be able to focus on developing skills in visualization. Visualizations offer the potential to enrich educational settings, making concepts more engaging, concrete, and accessible. Visualizations for student audiences present both challenges and opportunities. The challenges are grounded in the potentially limited background knowledge of students, the\u00a0\u2026",
        "Data visualization is the user-and task-oriented transformation of data from measurement or simulation, as well as from models (empirically crafted or machinelearned) into interactive images for exploration, analysis, and presentation. It has become an indispensable central part of the knowledge discovery process in many fields of contemporary endeavor. Since its inception about three decades ago, the techniques of data visualization have aided scientists, engineers, medical practitioners, analysts, and others in dealing with a wide variety of data. One of the powerful strengths of data visualization is the effective and efficient utilization of the human sensory and cognitive system to enable and support instructive exploration, complex analysis, and critical decision making, through the recognition of relevant patterns, the observation of unseen relations, and the identification of new connections with other data and\u00a0\u2026",
        "Many undergraduates who pursue a major in Computer Science (CS) at rural universities identify themselves as first-generation students. There is a large body of research that confirms first-generation students are more likely to switch from CS to a different major, or leave their university completely within the first year. In response, this study explored the challenges that first-generation students from rural backgrounds face, and factors that might increase their chances of retention and success within the major. Additionally, the study identified thematic differences between first-generation students and non-first-generation students that highlight potential setbacks, such as their previous exposure and preparation for CS concepts, and their confidence in their ability to succeed in the courses and major. The poster provides details of the survey and other evaluative protocols as well as the analysis results and\u00a0\u2026",
        "Visualizations intended for broad audiences present challenges and potential not typically seen in the more typical situation of creating visualizations through a close collaboration with a domain expert who is already motivated to understand the data through the visualization. In contrast to the explorative character of the process where visualization is used to gain a better understanding of new data within a research workflow, we will focus here on the development and design of fine-tuned visualizations or tools for communication purposes. More specifically, we define visualization for broad audiences as creating visualizations or visualization tools intended for heterogeneous audiences (who may have domain knowledge but differing abilities), distinct audience groups (domain experts in different part of a process who have different goals), large groups of collaborating experts, or the general public (who may have\u00a0\u2026",
        "Secure compilation is an emerging field that puts together advances in security, programming languages, verification, systems, and hardware architectures in order to devise secure compilation chains that eliminate many of today\u2019s vulnerabilities. Secure compilation aims to protect a source language\u2019s abstractions in compiled code, even against low-level attacks. For a concrete example, all modern languages provide a notion of structured control flow and an invoked procedure is expected to return to the right place. However, today\u2019s compilation chains (compilers, linkers, loaders, runtime systems, hardware) cannot efficiently enforce this abstraction: linked low-level code can call and return to arbitrary instructions or smash the stack, blatantly violating the highlevel abstraction. The emerging secure compilation community aims to address such problems by devising formal security criteria, efficient enforcement mechanisms, and effective proof techniques. This seminar strived to take a broad and inclusive view of secure compilation and to provide a forum for discussion on the topic. The goal was to identify interesting research directions and open challenges by bringing together people working on building secure compilation chains, on developing proof techniques and verification tools, and on designing security mechanisms.",
        "At our university, women are a minority in all computing and engineering majors. This situation is mirrored at other universities nationwide, as well as in technical industries. Stereotype threat, the risk of confirming a negative stereotype about one's social group, can result in women not performing as well as their male counterparts in computing, mathematics, and engineering courses. The aftermath of these experiences cause women to fear they do not belong or are not \"smart enough\", resulting in women switching to a different major. Even high-performing women can be subject to these pressures. We present a Scholar model for increasing gender diversity in technology fields and an evaluation of its impact on the retention and success of women in computing and engineering majors. We compare the performance of Scholars to that of non-Scholars with similar demographic and academic backgrounds who\u00a0\u2026",

        "Background Public reporting of hospital quality data is a key element of health care reform in the United States, with the goals of improving quality of care while reducing costs by encouraging reductions in preventable adverse events (PAE). Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a common PAE that cause substantial morbidity and mortality. HAI rates for hospitals are widely available online, including via http://medicare.gov/ hospitalcompare. Publishing these data requires considerable effort and expense for hospitals and the government. However, there has been little research on the ability of the general public to understand published HAI quality measures. Methods Aim 1: We assessed understanding of HAI data as presented on CMS Hospital Compare among a random sample of University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) patients. Participants compared HAI data for two hospitals, and the accuracy of their comparisons was assessed. Aim 2: We analyzed nationwide HAI data to determine their utility in distinguishing among hospitals, and assessed characteristics of this dataset (e.g. geographic areas with hospitals that have substantially different HAI denominators or risk-adjustment profiles) that inform how HAI data are presented. Aim 3: We developed a new method for presenting HAI data to the public. We then conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing this new method to the method from CMS Hospital Compare among a random sample of UMMC patients. Results Aim 1: Participants were able to correctly assess hospital performance 38% of the time (most complex data) to 72% (least complex) of the time. Aim 2: In many\u00a0\u2026",

        " Multivariate volume visualization is important for many applications including petroleum exploration and medicine. State\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art tools allow users to interactively explore volumes with multiple linked parameter\u2010space views. However, interactions in the parameter space using trial\u2010and\u2010error may be unintuitive and time consuming. Furthermore, switching between different views may be distracting. In this paper, we propose GuideME: a novel slice\u2010guided semiautomatic multivariate volume exploration approach. Specifically, the approach comprises four stages: attribute inspection, guided uncertainty\u2010aware lasso creation, automated feature extraction and optional spatial fine tuning and visualization. Throughout the exploration process, the user does not need to interact with the parameter views at all and examples of complex real\u2010world data demonstrate the usefulness, efficiency and ease\u2010of\u2010use of our method.",
        " Data visualization is now a popular medium for journalistic storytelling. However, current visualization tools either lack support for storytelling or require significant technical expertise. Informed by interviews with journalists, we introduce a model of storytelling abstractions that includes state\u2010based scene structure, dynamic annotations and decoupled coordination of multiple visualization components. We instantiate our model in Ellipsis: a system that combines a domain\u2010specific language (DSL) for storytelling with a graphical interface for story authoring. User interactions are automatically translated into statements in the Ellipsis DSL. By enabling storytelling without programming, the Ellipsis interface lowers the threshold for authoring narrative visualizations. We evaluate Ellipsis through example applications and user studies with award\u2010winning journalists. Study participants find Ellipsis to be a valuable prototyping\u00a0\u2026"
