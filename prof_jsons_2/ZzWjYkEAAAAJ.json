        "We report on our experiences fielding MeetingMayhem, an interactive game that we developed, which introduces students to fundamental concepts in network security, cybersecurity, and adversarial thinking. The game is intended for students who do not necessarily have any prior background in computer science. Assuming the role of agents, two players exchange messages over a network to try to agree on a meeting time and location, while an adversary interferes with their plan. Following the Dolev-Yao model, the adversary has full control of the network: they can see all messages and modify, block, or forward them. We designed the game as a web application, where groups of three students play the game, taking turns being the adversary. The adversary is a legitimate communicant on the network, and the agents do not know who is the other agent and who is the adversary. Through gameplay, we expect\u00a0\u2026",
        "We explore shadow information technology (IT) at institutions of higher education through a two-tiered approach involving a detailed case study and comprehensive survey of IT professionals. In its many forms, shadow IT is the software or hardware present in a computer system or network that lies outside the typical review process of the responsible IT unit. We carry out a case study of an internally built legacy grants management system at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County that exemplifies the vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting and SQL injection, typical of such unauthorized and ad-hoc software. We also conduct a survey of IT professionals at universities, colleges, and community colleges that reveals new and actionable information regarding the prevalence, usage patterns, types, benefits, and risks of shadow IT at their respective institutions. Further, we propose a security-based profile of\u00a0\u2026",
        "A boardroom election is an election with a small number of voters carried out with public communications. We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting protocol with ballot secrecy, fairness, and dispute-freeness. BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic encryption system in which each candidate is associated with a set of masked primes. Each voter engages in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter selects the index of a prime associated with a candidate and receives the selected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by encrypting their masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. By hiding the mapping between primes and candidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information to carry out effective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any partial tally\u2014until everyone has voted. In contrast to some existing boardroom\u00a0\u2026",
        "We present the first formal-methods analysis of the Session Binding Proxy (SBP) protocol, which protects a vulnerable system by wrapping it and introducing a reverse proxy between the system and its clients. SBP mitigates thefts of authentication cookies by cryptographically binding the authentication cookie---issued by the server to the client---to an underlying Transport Layer Security (TLS) channel using the channel's master secret and a secret key known only by the proxy. An adversary who steals a bound cookie cannot reuse this cookie to create malicious requests on a separate connection because the cookie's channel binding will not match the adversary's channel. SBP seeks to achieve this goal without modifications to the client or the server software, rendering the client and server ``oblivious protocol participants'' that are not aware of the SBP session. Our analysis verifies that the original SBP design mitigates cookie stealing under the client's cryptographic assumptions but fails to authenticate the client to the proxy. Resulting from two issues, the proxy has no assurance that it shares a session context with a legitimate client: SBP assumes an older flawed version of TLS (1.2), and SBP relies on legacy server usernames and passwords to authenticate clients. Due to these issues, there is no guarantee of cookie-stealing resistance from the proxy's cryptographic perspective. Using the Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer (CPSA), we model and analyze the original SBP and three variations in the Dolev-Yao network intruder model. Our models differ in the version of TLS they use: 1.2 (original SBP), 1.2 with mutual authentication, 1.3\u00a0\u2026",
        "We solve a long-standing challenge to the integrity of votes cast without the supervision of a voting booth: ``improper influence,'' which we define as any combination of vote buying and voter coercion. In comparison with previous proposals, our system is the first in the literature to protect against a strong adversary who learns all of the voter's keys---we call this property ``extreme coercion resistance.'' Our approach allows each voter, or their trusted agents (which we call ``hedgehogs''), to ``nullify'' (effectively cancel) their vote in a way that is unstoppable and irrevocable, and such that the nullification action is forever unattributable to that voter or their hedgehog(s). We demonstrate the security of VoteXX in the {universal composability} model. Additionally we provide concrete implementations of sub-protocols---including inalienable authentication, decentralized bulletin boards, and anonymous communication channels---that are usually left as abstract assumptions in the literature. As in many other coercion-resistant systems, voters are authorized to vote with public-private keys. Each voter registers their public keys with the Election Authority (EA) in a way that convinces the EA that the voter has complete knowledge of their private keys. Voters concerned about losing their private keys can themselves, or by delegating to one or more hedgehog(s), monitor the bulletin board for malicious ballots cast with their keys, and can act to nullify these ballots in a privacy-preserving manner with zero-knowledge proofs. In comparison with previous proposals, our system makes fewer assumptions and protects against a stronger adversary. For example, votexx\u00a0\u2026",
        "s a case study in cryptographic binding, we present a formal-methods analysis of the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) authentication protocol's cryptographic channel binding mechanisms. First, we show that UAF's channel bindings fail to mitigate protocol interaction by a Dolev-Yao (DY) adversary, enabling the adversary to transfer the server's authentication challenge to alternate sessions of the protocol. As a result, in some contexts, the adversary can masquerade as a client and establish an authenticated session with a server, which might be a bank server. Second, we implement a proof-of-concept man-in-the-middle attack against eBay's open source FIDO UAF implementation. Third, we propose and verify an improvement of UAF channel binding that better resists protocol interaction, in which the client and the server, rather than the client alone, bind the server's challenge to the session. The weakness we analyze is similar to the vulnerability discovered in the Needham-Schroeder protocol over 25 years ago. That this vulnerability appears in FIDO UAF highlights the strong need for protocol designers to bind messages properly and to analyze their designs with formal-methods tools. UAF's channel bindings fail for four reasons: channel binding is optional; the client cannot authenticate the server's challenge, even when channel binding is used; the standard permits the server to accept incorrect channel bindings; and the protocol binds only to the communication endpoints and not to the protocol session. We carry out our analysis of the standard and our suggested improvement using the Cryptographic\u00a0\u2026",
        "We present a psychometric evaluation of the Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment (CCA), completed by 193 students from seven colleges and universities. The CCA builds on our prior work developing and validating a Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI), which measures students' conceptual understanding of cybersecurity after a first course in the area. The CCA deepens the conceptual complexity and technical depth expectations, assessing conceptual knowledge of students who had completed multiple courses in cybersecurity. We review our development of the CCA and present our evaluation of the instrument using Classical Test Theory and Item-Response Theory. The CCA is a difficult assessment, providing reliable measurements of student knowledge and deeper information about high-performing students.",
        "We solve a long-standing challenge to the integrity of votes cast without the supervision of a voting booth:\u201cimproper influence,\u201d which we define as any combination of vote buying and voter coercion. Our approach allows each voter, or their trusted agent (s), to cancel their vote in a way that is unstoppable, irrevocable, and forever unattributable to the voter. In particular, our approach enhances security of online, remote, public-sector elections, for which there is a growing need and the threat of improper influence is most acute. In this extended abstract, we introduce the new approach, compare it with previous methods, and concisely summarize the protocols. In our full paper, we give detailed cryptographic protocols, show how they can be applied to several voting settings, describe our implementation in a full voting system called VoteXX, and provide UC proofs. Our system protects against the strongest adversary considered in prior related work and is suitable for widespread use in public elections.",
        "We present and analyze User Discovery with Minimal information disclosure (UDM), a new protocol for user discovery in anonymous communication systems that minimizes the information disclosed to the system and users. UDM solves the following user-discovery problem. User Alice wishes to communicate with Bob over an anonymous communication system, such as cMix or Tor. Initially, each party knows each other\u2019s public contact identifier (e.g., email address or phone number), but neither knows the other\u2019s private platform identifier in the communication system. If both parties wish to communicate with each other, UDM enables them to establish a shared secret and learn each other\u2019s private platform identifier. Unlike existing systems, including those based on private set intersection, UDM learns nothing about the social contacts of the users, is not vulnerable to off-line dictionary attacks that expose contact lists\u00a0\u2026",
        "We present Phrase-Verified Voting, a voter-verifiable remote voting system easily assembled from commercial off-the-shelf software for small private elections. The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally includes their ballot selection without requiring any understanding of cryptography. This system is an example of making voter verification usable. The paper describes the system and an experience with it in fall 2020, to vote remotely in promotion committees in a university. Each voter fills out a form in the cloud with their selection V for each race and a two-word passphrase P. The system generates a verification prompt of the (V, P) pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their (V, P) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially appropriate for any small group making\u00a0\u2026",
        "We present a psychometric evaluation of a revised version of the Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI), completed by 354 students from 29 colleges and universities. The CCI is a conceptual test of understanding created to enable research on instruction quality in cybersecurity education. This work extends previous expert review and small-scale pilot testing of the CCI. Results show that the CCI aligns with a curriculum many instructors expect from an introductory cybersecurity course, and that it is a valid and reliable tool for assessing what conceptual cybersecurity knowledge students learned.",
        "We introduce AOT, an anonymous communication system based on mix network architecture that uses oblivious transfer (OT) to deliver messages. Using OT to deliver messages helps AOT resist blending () attacks and helps AOT preserve receiver anonymity, even if a covert adversary controls all nodes in AOT. AOT comprises three levels of nodes, where nodes at each level perform a different function and can scale horizontally. The sender encrypts their payload and a tag, derived from a secret shared between the sender and receiver, with the public key of a Level-2 node and sends them to a Level-1 node. On a public bulletin board, Level-3 nodes publish tags associated with messages ready to be retrieved. Each receiver checks the bulletin board, identifies tags, and receives the associated messages using OT. A receiver can receive their messages even if the receiver is offline when messages are ready. Through what we call a \"handshake\" process, communicants can use the AOT protocol to establish shared secrets anonymously. Users play an active role in contributing to the unlinkability of messages: periodically, users initiate requests to AOT to receive dummy messages, such that an adversary cannot distinguish real and dummy requests.",
        "We solve the most challenging obstacle to casting votes online:\u201cimproper influence,\u201d typically defined as vote buying or voter coercion. This problem has been the greatest barrier to mainstream adoption of online voting systems, whether the voter receives the ballot online or by mail. Our conceptual breakthrough allows each voter, or their trusted associates (which we call \u201chedgehogs\u201d), to \u201cnullify\u201d(cancel) their vote in a way that is anonymous, unstoppable, and irrevocable. The separate nullification stage requires fewer assumptions than do other approaches, thereby strengthening security and increasing practicality, while simplifying and speeding up registration and vote casting. Though our nullification technology can be readily applied to almost all types of elections for which the tally is publicly auditable online, its benefits are greatest for votes cast beyond polling places, where the threat of improper influence is most acute. It addresses current trends: elections are moving online despite the growing ease by which voters can be paid and coerced electronically. Nullification will help make it prudent to vote online, which is the type of voting advocates have long believed needed for democracy to reach its potential.",

        " We analyze the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol for structural weaknesses using the Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer (CPSA) in the first formal analysis of SRP (specifically, Version\u00a03). SRP is a widely deployed Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol used in 1Password, iCloud Keychain, and other products. As with many PAKE protocols, two participants use knowledge of a pre-shared password to authenticate each other and establish a session key. SRP aims to resist dictionary attacks, not store plaintext-equivalent passwords on the server, avoid patent infringement, and avoid export controls by not using encryption. Formal analysis of SRP is challenging in part because existing tools provide no simple way to reason about its use of the mathematical expression .

        "We perform a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic analysis of Matt Bishop\u2019s widely used 1440-page textbook on cybersecurity. To our knowledge, our work is the first time such analysis has been carried out on any singleauthored work of this length. This topic analysis might be useful for creating a supplemental interactive guide to the textbook to help readers explore the book more efficiently for particular learning objectives.",
        "We analyze the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol for structural weaknesses using the Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer (CPSA) in the first formal analysis of SRP (specifically, Version 3).

SRP aims to resist dictionary attacks, not store plaintext-equivalent passwords on the server, avoid patent infringement, and avoid export controls by not using encryption. Formal analysis of SRP is challenging in part because existing tools provide no simple way to reason about its use of the mathematical expression \u201cv + g b mod q\u201d. Modeling v + g b as encryption, we complete an exhaustive study of all possible execution sequences of SRP. Ignoring possible algebraic attacks, this analysis detects no major structural weakness, and in particular no leakage of any secrets. We do uncover one notable weakness of SRP, which follows from its design constraints. It is possible for a malicious server to fake an authentication session with a client, without the client\u2019s participation. This action might facilitate an escalation of privilege attack, if the client has higher privileges than does the server. We conceived of this attack before we used CPSA and confirmed it by generating corresponding execution shapes using CPSA.",
        "A boardroom election is an election that takes place in a single room -- the boardroom -- in which all voters can see and hear each other. We present an initial exploration of boardroom elections with ballot privacy and voter verifiability that use only \"low-tech cryptography\" without using computers to mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel ways. Our new building blocks include \"foldable ballots\" that can be rotated to hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and \"visual secrets\" that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence. Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Pr\\^{e}t-\\`{a}-Voter. This paper's building blocks and protocol are meant to be a proof of concept that might be tested for usability and improved.",
        " We reflect on our ongoing journey in the educational Cybersecurity Assessment Tools (CATS) Project to create two concept inventories for cybersecurity. We identify key steps in this journey and important questions we faced. We explain the decisions we made and discuss the consequences of those decisions, highlighting what worked well and what might have gone better. The CATS Project is creating and validating two concept inventories\u2014conceptual tests of understanding\u2014that can be used to measure the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching and learning cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI) is for students who have recently completed any first course in cybersecurity; the Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment (CCA) is for students who have recently completed an undergraduate major or track in cybersecurity.
