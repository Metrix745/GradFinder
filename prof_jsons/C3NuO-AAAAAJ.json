        "The growing use of PDFs has made them a prime target for malware attacks. Machine learning-based approaches for detecting PDF malware are increasingly popular due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the effectiveness of these systems largely depends on the quality of the dataset and the features used. Additionally, they face challenges from sophisticated evasion attacks. This paper introduces a compact yet highly effective feature set, consisting of just five features, designed to improve training efficiency and enhance the robustness of PDF malware detection models. Through experiments, including tests on the real-world detection system PDFRATE, we demonstrate that our proposed feature set not only trains highly accurate models but also increases the system's robustness against a specific evasive attack known as the Benign Random Noise (BRN) attack.",
        "In several Machine Learning (ML) clustering and dimensionality reduction approaches, such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), RESCAL, and K-Means clustering, users must select a hyper-parameter k to define the number of clusters or components that yield an ideal separation of samples or clean clusters. This selection, while difficult, is crucial to avoid overfitting or underfitting the data. Several ML applications use scoring methods (e.g., Silhouette and Davies Boulding scores) to evaluate the cluster pattern stability for a specific k. The score is calculated for different trials over a range of k, and the ideal k is heuristically selected as the value before the model starts overfitting, indicated by a drop or increase in the score resembling an elbow curve plot. While the grid-search method can be used to accurately find a good k value, visiting a range of k can become time-consuming and computationally resource-intensive. In this paper, we introduce the Binary Bleed method based on binary search, which significantly reduces the k search space for these grid-search ML algorithms by truncating the target k values from the search space using a heuristic with thresholding over the scores. Binary Bleed is designed to work with single-node serial, single-node multi-processing, and distributed computing resources. In our experiments, we demonstrate the reduced search space gain over a naive sequential search of the ideal k and the accuracy of the Binary Bleed in identifying the correct k for NMFk, K-Means pyDNMFk, and pyDRESCALk with Silhouette and Davies Boulding scores. We make our implementation of Binary Bleed for the NMF\u00a0\u2026",
        "Much of human knowledge in cybersecurity is encapsulated within the ever-growing volume of scientific papers. As this textual data continues to expand, the importance of document organization methods becomes increasingly crucial for extracting actionable insights hidden within large text datasets. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) serve as a means to store factual information in a structured manner, providing explicit, interpretable knowledge that includes domain-specific information from the cybersecurity scientific literature. One of the challenges in constructing a KG from scientific literature is the extraction of ontology from unstructured text. In this paper, we address this topic and introduce a method for building a multi-modal KG by extracting structured ontology from scientific papers. We demonstrate this concept in the cybersecurity domain. One modality of the KG represents observable information from the papers\u00a0\u2026",
        "The ability to interact with machines using natural human language is becoming not just commonplace, but expected. The next step is not just text interfaces, but speech interfaces and not just with computers, but with all machines including robots. In this paper, we chronicle the recent history of this growing field of spoken dialogue with robots and offer the community three proposals, the first focused on education, the second on benchmarks, and the third on the modeling of language when it comes to spoken interaction with robots. The three proposals should act as white papers for any researcher to take and build upon.",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been the focus of intense interest in the past few years for the artificial intelligence (AI) community and their use in interactive robots for industry has had equal interest; however, there do not currently exist guidelines for or categorizations of their use in different application spaces. In this workshop, we bring together academic researchers and industry practitioners who are using or are interested in LLMs for human-robot interaction (HRI), and who can contribute to the development of a higher level, community-wide evaluation of how LLMs can fit correctly and defensibly into the future of HRI. Relevant topics to this workshop include HRI studies that involve LLMs directly or indirectly, technical contributions that involve utilizing or modifying LLMs, and HRI studies that utilize the idea of \"Scarecrows'' within a larger system. We also intend to incorporate work on the broader questions\u00a0\u2026",
        "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents both a critical design challenge and a remarkable opportunity for the field of Human\u2013Robot Interaction (HRI). While the direct deployment of LLMs on interactive robots may be unsuitable for reasons of ethics, safety, and control, LLMs might nevertheless provide a promising baseline technique for many elements of HRI. Specifically, in this article, we argue for the use of LLMs as Scarecrows: \u201cbrainless,\u201d straw-man black-box modules integrated into robot architectures for the purpose of quickly enabling full-pipeline solutions, much like the use of \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d (WoZ) and other human-in-the-loop approaches. We explicitly acknowledge that these Scarecrows, rather than providing a satisfying or scientifically complete solution, incorporate a form of the wisdom of the crowd and, in at least some cases, will ultimately need to be replaced or supplemented by a\u00a0\u2026",
        "Virtual reality is progressively more widely used to support embodied AI agents, such as robots, which frequently engage in \u2018sim-to-real\u2019 based learning approaches. At the same time, tools such as large vision-and-language models offer new capabilities that tie into a wide variety of tasks and capabilities. In order to understand how such agents can learn from simulated environments, we explore a language model\u2019s ability to recover the type of object represented by a photorealistic 3D model as a function of the 3D perspective from which the model is viewed. We used photogrammetry to create 3D models of commonplace objects and rendered 2D images of these models from an fixed set of 420 virtual camera perspectives. A well-studied image and language model (CLIP) was used to generate text (i.e., prompts) corresponding to these images. Using multiple instances of various object classes, we studied which\u00a0\u2026",
        "Industry practitioners care about small improvements in malware detection accuracy because their models are deployed to hundreds of millions of machines, meaning a 0.1\\% change can cause an overwhelming number of false positives. However, academic research is often restrained to public datasets on the order of ten thousand samples and is too small to detect improvements that may be relevant to industry. Working within these constraints, we devise an approach to generate a benchmark of configurable difficulty from a pool of available samples. This is done by leveraging malware family information from tools like AVClass to construct training/test splits that have different generalization rates, as measured by a secondary model. Our experiments will demonstrate that using a less accurate secondary model with disparate features is effective at producing benchmarks for a more sophisticated target model that is under evaluation. We also ablate against alternative designs to show the need for our approach.",
        "With the widespread use of the Portable Document Format (PDF), it\u2019s increasingly becoming a target for malware, highlighting the need for effective detection solutions. In recent years, machine learning-based methods for PDF malware detection have grown in popularity. However, the effectiveness of ML models is closely related to the quality of the training datasets. In this research, we investigated two widely used PDF malware datasets: Contagio and CIC. We found biases and representativeness issues that could affect the reliability and applicability of models built on them. Our statistical analysis revealed marked difference between these datasets and PDF malware samples from VirusTotal, as well as benign PDFs from Govdocs, pointing to the necessity for more representative datasets in PDF malware research.. To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset: PdfRep. Our findings demonstrate that PdfRep\u00a0\u2026",
        "Differential Diagnosis (DDx) is the process of identifying the most likely medical condition among the possible pathologies through the process of elimination based on evidence. An automated process that narrows a large set of pathologies down to the most likely pathologies will be of great importance. The primary prior works have relied on the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm under the intuition that it aligns better with how physicians perform DDx. In this paper, we show that a generative approach trained with simpler supervised and self-supervised learning signals can achieve superior results on the current benchmark. The proposed Transformer-based generative network, named DDxT, autoregressively produces a set of possible pathologies, i.e., DDx, and predicts the actual pathology using a neural network. Experiments are performed using the DDXPlus dataset. In the case of DDx, the proposed network has achieved a mean accuracy of  and a mean F1 score of . Additionally, mean accuracy reaches  with a mean F1 score of  while predicting ground truth pathology. The proposed DDxT outperformed the previous RL-based approaches by a big margin. Overall, the automated Transformer-based DDx generative model has the potential to become a useful tool for a physician in times of urgency.",

        "Over the past decade, the machine learning security community has developed a myriad of defenses for evasion attacks. An understudied question in that community is: for whom do these defenses defend? This work considers common approaches to defending learned systems and how security defenses result in performance inequities across different sub-populations. We outline appropriate parity metrics for analysis and begin to answer this question through empirical results of the fairness implications of machine learning security methods. We find that many methods that have been proposed can cause direct harm, like false rejection and unequal benefits from robustness training. The framework we propose for measuring defense equality can be applied to robustly trained models, preprocessing-based defenses, and rejection methods. We identify a set of datasets with a user-centered application and a\u00a0\u2026",
        "Human-robot interaction is a critical area of research, providing support for collaborative tasks where a human instructs a robot to interact with and manipulate objects in an environment.",
        "Our study is motivated by robotics, where when dealing with robots or other physical systems, we often need to balance competing concerns of relying on complex, multimodal data coming from a variety of sensors with a general lack of large representative datasets.  Despite the complexity of modern robotic platforms and the need for multimodal interaction, there has been little research on integrating more than two modalities in a low data regime with the real-world constraint that sensors fail due to obstructions or adverse conditions. In this work, we consider a case in which natural language is used as a retrieval query against objects, represented across multiple modalities, in a physical environment. We introduce extended multimodal alignment (EMMA), a method that learns to select the appropriate object while jointly refining modality-specific embeddings through a geometric (distancebased) loss. In contrast to prior work, our approach is able to incorporate an arbitrary number of views (modalities) of a particular piece of data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model on a grounded language object retrieval scenario. We show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines when little training data is available. Our code is available at https://github.com/kasraprime/EMMA.",
        "Intuitively, students who start a homework assignment earlier and spend more time on it should receive better grades on the assignment. However, existing literature on the impact of time spent on homework is not clear-cut and comes mostly from K-12 education. It is not clear that these prior studies can inform coursework in deep learning due to differences in demographics, as well as the computational time needed for assignments to be completed. We study this problem in a post-hoc study of three semesters of a deep learning course at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), and develop a hierarchical Bayesian model to help make principled conclusions about the impact on student success given an approximate measure of the total time spent on the homework, and how early they submitted the assignment. Our results show that both submitting early and spending more time positively relate with\u00a0\u2026",
        "Machine learning-based methods for PDF malware detection have grown in popularity because of their high levels of accuracy. However, many well-known ML-based detectors require a large number of specimen features to be collected before making a decision, which can be time-consuming. In this study, we present a novel, distance-based method for detecting PDF malware. Notably, our approach needs significantly less training data compared to traditional machine learning or neural network models. We evaluated our method using the Contagio dataset and reported that it can detect 90.50% of malware samples with only 20 benign PDF files used for model training. To show the statistical significance, we reported results with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We evaluated our model's performance across multiple metrics including Accuracy, F1 score, Precision, and Recall, alongside False Positive Rate, False\u00a0\u2026",

        "In this chapter, language is considered as a mechanism of referencing concepts in the physical world, and how natural language processing dovetails with work on using speech and making sense of language in a robot's environment is explored. Grounded language acquisition as a research area is examined, and a case study is presented of learning grounded language from speech by examining the question from three distinct-but-related angles: the need for complex perceptual data (and a resulting corpus), the need to learn to interact directly from speech without using a textual intermediary, and the problem of learning grounded language from richly multimodal data.",
        "The overarching goal of this work is to enable the collection of language describing a wide variety of objects viewed in virtual reality. We aim to create full 3D models from a small number of \u2018keyframe\u2019images of objects found in the publicly available Grounded Language Dataset (GoLD) using photogrammetry. We will then collect linguistic descriptions by placing our models in virtual reality and having volunteers describe them. To evaluate the impact of virtual reality immersion on linguistic descriptions of the objects, we intend to apply contrastive learning to perform grounded language learning, then compare the descriptions collected from images (in GoLD) versus our models.",
        "While VR as an interface for the teleoperation of robots has been well-studied in recent years, VR can also be used to advance our understanding of in-person human-robot interaction (HRI) by sim-ulating such interactions more repeatably and affordably than real-world studies. A few platforms now exist for studying human-robot interaction in VR, but little of this work has involved the study of the realism of specific, typical in-person HRI tasks. To evaluate this realism, we conduct a user study consisting of a collaborative assembly task where a robot and human work together to build a simple electrical circuit. We present a comparison of the task performed in the real world versus with virtual robot in VR. We discuss difficulties encountered and draw conclusions about what characteristics a virtual environment should have in order to support physical human-robot interactions."
